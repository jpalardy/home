The web pages hosted at [home.jpalardy.com].

## What is it?

The [home.jpalardy.com] page is my home page. It is my command-line
interface to the web. Inspired by [yubnub.org], it runs in JavaScript and does
NOT log any history.

A _command_ with a query will perform that query on a specific site: (Google
image, in this case)

    > gim muffins

A _command_ without a query will open the site's home page:

    > gim

## Why?

The web is about searching, and searching goes beyond Google.

If I already know what site I want to end up on (github, amazon, google map), why go
through the extra step of searching on Google and clicking my way through?

## How?
